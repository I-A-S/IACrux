## **About**
IACrux is a foundation library designed to serve as the dependency root for Independent Architecture (IA) software.

Unlike general-purpose libraries, IACrux is opinionated and built specifically to streamline the development of our higher-level rendering, physics, and system tools. It provides a unified C++20 interface for OS abstractions, memory manipulation, and utilities, abstracting away platform-specific implementations so future projects can focus purely on logic.

Note: This project is tailored for our internal specific development environments and enforces the use of Clang across all platforms (Windows, Linux, and WebAssembly).
